See individual directories for specific build notes. All but `vmgr` will run on either an unexpanded Commodore 64 or Commodore 128 in 64 mode, or on an Apple IIe, IIc or IIgs with at least 64K of memory. Pre-built example binaries are available from the Releases tab.

It is recommended you start with the Hello, World example and proceed alphabetically, since each succeeding example increases in complexity.
